# Project Status

Supersedes `PHASE0_PROGRESS.md` (kept below for historical environment notes). Last updated after completing the full phased roadmap (ARCHITECTURE.md section 9, Phases 0-14) plus a follow-up session closing several "manual driver" gaps.

## Where things stand

Every phase in the roadmap has a working, confirmed-compiling implementation. See `CHANGELOG.md` [0.2.0] for the full file-by-file list. This is still first-version work throughout -- crude but functional, not polished -- consistent with how the project was built: get something real and testable first, refine later.

**What now runs automatically** (no longer needs a manual driver call):
- `MCF_Core_TickManagerComponent`, via `MCF_Core_GameLoopComponent`'s `EOnFrame`
- `MCF_AI_CommandWatchdogComponent`, via `MCF_Core_TickCritical`
- `MCF_Hostility_Manager` decay, via `MCF_Core_TickCosmetic` (once `StartAutoDecay()` is called)
- `MCF_React_SequencePlaybackComponent`, via its own `EOnFrame`

**What still needs a manual driver:**
- `MCF_React_SequenceRecorderComponent.RecordSample()`/`RecordCue()` (recording is an authoring-time action, not live gameplay -- lower priority than the pieces above)

## Confirmed-working engine APIs (no longer need re-verifying)

- `EOnInit`, `OnDelete`, `EOnFrame` + `SetEventMask(owner, EntityEvent.FRAME)`
- `GetGame().GetWorld().GetWorldTime()`
- `Math.RandomFloat01()`, `Math.RandomInt()`, `Math.Clamp()`, `Math.Acos()`, `Math.RAD2DEG`
- `vector.Distance()`, `vector.Dot()`, `.Normalize()`
- `ScriptInvoker` (via `GetInvoker().Insert()/.Remove()` -- **not** `ScriptInvokerBase` as a bare parameter type, that does not compile)
- `string.Split()`, `string.Format()`, `.ToInt()`
- `FindComponent()`, `Cast()`
- `SCR_EditableEntityComponent` requires a `RplComponent` with its own GUID to avoid a "missing RplComponent" error on placeable prefabs

## Deliberately unsolved, by design (not oversights)

- **No raycast/navmesh API was ever confirmed.** Rather than guess, two workarounds were built instead:
  - `MCF_AI_ComplianceComponent.IsBeingAimedAt()` -- distance + angle approximation, not true line-of-sight
  - `MCF_AI_FallbackPointRegistry` -- mission-maker-placed safe points instead of a geometry query
- **AND logic** (`MCF_Obj_LogicComponent`) is capped at 4 fixed input slots, not an arbitrary list -- Enforce Script has no closures to generate per-input callbacks dynamically.
- **Animation/movement execution is not wired up** for `MCF_AI_WaypointAnimationComponent`, `MCF_AI_AmbientActorComponent`, or Sequence Playback's position data -- all of these publish/expose what *should* happen; nothing yet makes a character actually walk or play the animation. This is the single biggest remaining category of "event fires but nothing visibly happens" gaps.
- **No GameMode component exists yet.** Several managers (`MCF_AAR_DebriefManager.StartListening()`, `MCF_Hostility_Manager.StartAutoDecay()`) are designed to be kicked off from a game mode's `OnGameStart()`, but nothing currently calls them automatically at mission start.

## Reload/compile-check workflow reminder

`enfusion-mcp:wb_reload` is frequently flaky -- it often reports success without a fresh compile actually appearing in the log. When that happens: retry a few times with 15-20s waits, and if it stays stuck, ask whoever is at the PC to click into the Workbench window (giving it focus reliably un-sticks it). Always confirm via the log's `Compiling Game scripts took` / `SCRIPT (E)` lines, never trust the tool's "Reload Complete" message alone.

# Historical: original Phase 0 handoff notes

The section below is the original handoff document written after Phase 0 alone. Kept for the environment-setup context (Workbench launch quirks, MCP tool history); the "what compiles" and "not yet started" sections are outdated -- see above instead.

## Environment, confirmed working

- Repo: `G:\MCF` (git, `main` branch)
- Workbench project: `G:\MCF\addons\MCF\addon.gproj`
- **Launching Workbench reliably only works when the user starts it manually** (Steam UI or a desktop shortcut). Scripted launches (`wb_launch`, direct .exe, `steam.exe -applaunch`) were all unreliable for resolving the base-game addon path.
- Once running (World Editor mode, Net API enabled), `enfusion-mcp` tools work normally.
- `enfusion-mcp:mod_build` also spawns its own process and hits the same launch issue -- use `wb_reload` against an already-running, user-launched instance instead.
